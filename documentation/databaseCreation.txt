# This file is an explanation file explaining how to set up
    the postgreSQL database. 

# Go to this link and download postgreSQL 16.4 for your version
    of pc and then run the executable (Don't forget to set an 
    admin password and check that port is 5432):
https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

# Run the following command in command prompt at the
    backend directory and enter password:
createdb --username=postgres hospitalSystem

# If the above line caused an error go to the folder you downloaded
    postgreSQL at, go to "PostgreSQL/16/bin", open in terminal and run:
./createdb --username=postgres hospitalSystem

# Create a file called personalSettings.py in the outer backend directory 
    and paste the following as its contents (your db information in quotations):

# Database Info
tableName = "hospitalSystem"
dbUser = <userName> # If you have not created a user it is most probably postgres
dbPassword = <password>
dbPort = "5432"

# Run the following in your terminal to initialize
    and seed the database:
python init_db.py
python seed_db.py

# If you want to check your database and the information you send use "pgAdmin 4" downloaded with
    your postgreSQL installation. On the left side (Object Explorer) go to: 
    Servers -> PostgreSQL 16 -> Databases -> hospitalSystem -> Schemas

# In case something breaks or you send excess data to the database run the following
    command and restart from line 13:
dropdb --username=postgres hospitalSystem

# If you again get a non definition error do the same as the line 16 suggests. Go to "PostgreSQL/16/bin"
    and run the following command. Then restart from line 16:
./dropdb --username=postgres hospitalSystem
